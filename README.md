The tracker tracks and file inside directories under the directory where the tracker is located in. When run it collects files which have been modified or create before 24 hrs ( the time can be modified in the code) and move them to last_24hrs folder. When it's been more than 24 hrs since the modification of the files they get moved back to their orginal path.

The calculations module can be used to do some basic or power calculations.
